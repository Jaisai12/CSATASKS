    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>Grease and flour your cake pans to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and
        fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder.</li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with
        the milk.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick
        inserted into the center comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10
        minutes.
